Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the ___ on ___. His Hct on admission 
had dropped significantly to 17.9 from 31.9, which was thought 
to be dilutional due to aggressive fluid resuscitation. His 
bilateral lower extremities were noted to be tense and so a 
fasciotomy was performed at bedside by the orthopedic service. 
However, the incisions continued to exsanguinate profusely and 
so orthopedics reevaluated the incisions with the ACS service 
multiple times without a notable focal bleeding site. Diffuse 
oozing was due to the coagulopathy, which was aggressively 
attempted to be corrected with a massive transfusion protocol. 
On ___, his abdomen was also noted to have increased 
pressure, as shown by his elevated bladder pressure, and so an 
emergent ex-lap was performed with Abthera vac placement. He 
continued to require higher vent settings during this time and 
was on CRRT since admission for his hyperkalemia. However, his 
hyperkalemia continued to get worsened despite aggressive 
correction. He also had received a repeat head CT on ___ 
for concern of unequal pupils, but was stable. On ___, 
patient showed widened complex and coded. ACLS was performed for 
about 1.5-2hrs with aggressive correction of hyperkalemia. 
Patient was finally pronounced dead on ___ at 0255.

Brief Hospital Course:
She underwent a normal vaginal delivery on ___. She had 
an abruption during labor, and the placenta was delivered 
spontaneously intact.  After delivery of the placenta, there was 
passage of a large amount of post-placental clot.  There
then was manual evacuation of another large amount of clots from 
the uterus right after delivery under anesthesia using fentanyl 
IV alone.  After that, she was given 1000 mcg of Cytotec.  She 
responded well, and there was minimal bleeding. Three hours 
later, she was noted to have a uterine fundus that was rising 
and reaccumulation of blood clots.  Decision was made to go to 
the operating room for manual extraction of these clots, as the 
epidural anesthetic was not working.

She underwent MAC anesthesia, and ultrasound showed clot in the 
intrauterine cavity. Under direct visualization, there was 
manual removal of another 200 cc of clot.  Manual removal was 
then completed, and it was noted that there was a clear
endometrial stripe.  There was some brief uterine atony, and 
that was treated with 0.2 mg of Methergine IM.  Tone was then 
excellent and bleeding halted, and the procedure was called to a 
close.

Her postpartum course was otherwise uncomplicated. Her pain was 
treated with oral pain medications. She ambulated and her foley 
was discontinued and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without incident. 

By postpartum day 3, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was 
then discharged home in stable condition with postpartum 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.
