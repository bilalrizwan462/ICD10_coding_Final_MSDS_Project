Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was taken to the ___ on ___. His Hct on admission 
had dropped significantly to 17.9 from 31.9, which was thought 
to be dilutional due to aggressive fluid resuscitation. His 
bilateral lower extremities were noted to be tense and so a 
fasciotomy was performed at bedside by the orthopedic service. 
However, the incisions continued to exsanguinate profusely and 
so orthopedics reevaluated the incisions with the ACS service 
multiple times without a notable focal bleeding site. Diffuse 
oozing was due to the coagulopathy, which was aggressively 
attempted to be corrected with a massive transfusion protocol. 
On ___, his abdomen was also noted to have increased 
pressure, as shown by his elevated bladder pressure, and so an 
emergent ex-lap was performed with Abthera vac placement. He 
continued to require higher vent settings during this time and 
was on CRRT since admission for his hyperkalemia. However, his 
hyperkalemia continued to get worsened despite aggressive 
correction. He also had received a repeat head CT on ___ 
for concern of unequal pupils, but was stable. On ___, 
patient showed widened complex and coded. ACLS was performed for 
about 1.5-2hrs with aggressive correction of hyperkalemia. 
Patient was finally pronounced dead on ___ at 0255.

Brief Hospital Course:
She underwent a normal vaginal delivery on ___. She had 
an abruption during labor, and the placenta was delivered 
spontaneously intact.  After delivery of the placenta, there was 
passage of a large amount of post-placental clot.  There
then was manual evacuation of another large amount of clots from 
the uterus right after delivery under anesthesia using fentanyl 
IV alone.  After that, she was given 1000 mcg of Cytotec.  She 
responded well, and there was minimal bleeding. Three hours 
later, she was noted to have a uterine fundus that was rising 
and reaccumulation of blood clots.  Decision was made to go to 
the operating room for manual extraction of these clots, as the 
epidural anesthetic was not working.

She underwent MAC anesthesia, and ultrasound showed clot in the 
intrauterine cavity. Under direct visualization, there was 
manual removal of another 200 cc of clot.  Manual removal was 
then completed, and it was noted that there was a clear
endometrial stripe.  There was some brief uterine atony, and 
that was treated with 0.2 mg of Methergine IM.  Tone was then 
excellent and bleeding halted, and the procedure was called to a 
close.

Her postpartum course was otherwise uncomplicated. Her pain was 
treated with oral pain medications. She ambulated and her foley 
was discontinued and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without incident. 

By postpartum day 3, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was 
then discharged home in stable condition with postpartum 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, the patient no longer had any respiratory 
symptoms, and was saturating well both standing and while lying 
down. Therefore, the plan for a thoracentesis was canceled. Both 
the hematology and acute care surgery teams were consulted, who 
recommended an excisional biopsy of his right inguinal node. 
This showed lymphoma. In preparation for possible chemotherapy, 
he had a TTE which was normal. HIV and Hep C serologies were 
negative, and his Hep B serologies were consistent with a 
cleared infection. An SPEP was sent, and is pending. Ultimately, 
the hematology team recommended that the patient remain 
inpatient while awaiting immunophenotyping, with concerns for an 
aggressive lymphoma. However, the patient strongly desired to 
return home and follow up as an outpatient. The risks of leaving 
were discussed, including the risk of decompensation or death, 
and the patient stated that he understood. As he has capacity to 
make his own decisions, he was therefore discharged, and will 
follow up with the hematology team as an outpatient.

dramatically, his leukocytosis downtrended, and on HD#2 he was 
off oxygen. Because of no changes in cough or sputum production, 
he was not treated for a COPD exacerbation. He received four 
days of IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin as an inpatient; because 
he received two days as well as an outpatient, he completed a 
course and did not receive any antibiotics on discharge. He will 
follow up with his pulmonologist and his PCP.

bodies, age indeterminate. 
-The dense-basion interval is at the upper limits of normal and 
there is questioned inferior migration of the dens relative to 
the anterior arch of C1.

negative for additional injury. 

Since being on the floor he has been stable. He denies any pain. 
He was deemed ready for discharge. Before discharge was 
finalized, patient left on his own without informing any staff 
members. He was unable to leave with a script for 2 additional 
days of Keppra which was recommended for seizure prophylaxis.

placenta. She was taken back to the OR for a manual extraction 
of her placenta. Her estimated blood loss was 200cc during the 
delivery and another 200cc in the operating room during removal 
of the placenta. Immediately postpartum, she was initiated on 24 
hours of kefzol. 

Once admitted to the postpartum floor her pain was controlled 
with acetaminophen and oxycodone. She did well on the floor and 
was initiated on a bowel regimen for her third degree tear. Her 
vital signs remained stable during her hospital stay. She was 
asymptomatic.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with Crohn's on infliximab here for an elective AVNRT
ablation after sustaining a syncopal event in the setting of
tachycardia. During her procedure she suddenly developed
bradycardia, nausea and shortly thereafter continuous ECG
monitoring demonstrated ST elevations in I, aVL, V2 with 
inferior
STD. She subsequently developed multiple episodes of ventricular
fibrillation requiring defibrillation and CPR >20 minutes before
receiving VA ECMO cannulation ___ RA, FA) with distal 
perfusion
via RSFA. She underwent coronary angiography with OCT which was
notable for a mid-LAD total occlusion with subsequent more
proximal LAD occlusion and a hazy proximal left circumflex
artery. Export thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty was peformed
to the proximal LAD with minimal thrombus; and most consistent
with vasospasm. Her course has been complicated by severe DIC
requiring massive blood transfusions; recurrent VF episodes
requiring relook coronary angiography and further export
thrombectomy; and a progressively rigid abdomen with decreasing
ECMO circuit flow. Vascular surgery, hematology, and general
surgery were consulted for help identifying the cause of her
precipitous blood loss; DIC; and abdominal distention,
respectively. At this time, the patient has been emergently 
taken
by general surgery for an exploratory laparotomy given evidence
of abdominal compartment syndrome leading to ECMO compromise.
DIC may have been precipitated by her cardiac arrest and/or 
liver lacerations. She continued to have VF despite
therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin and repeated coronary
angiograms shows presumed coronary vasospasm +/- small burden of
thrombus.  Her bleeding was unfortunately unable to be 
controlled and thus a family discussion about her grave 
prognosis was held. The patient expired on ___.

examination has been unable to be achieved. However, on 
post-operative day one his right pupil was dilated and then 
blown. He received CT noncontrast which showed infarction in the 
right hemisphere with edema and subfalcine and central 
herniation. Neurology and neurosurgery were called for 
therapeutic options and prognostication. Both felt that 
prognosis was very poor and that there was nothing further to be 
done to improve his chances of improvement. The patient's wife 
was called and notified of this change. The family gathered at 
the bedside the following day and decided to withdraw care. He 
expired a short time later.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery chronic htn and superimposed 
pre-eclampsia

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___ Ms. ___ underwent a vacuum assisted vaginal 
delivery (performed for maternal exhaustion and a category 2 
fetal heart tracing) after an induction of labor for chronic 
hypertension and GDMA1. Her course was complicated by 
superimposed preeclampsia, severe by blood pressures. Her 
initial labs were notable for a P/C of 0.3, with the remainder 
of her preeclampsia labs within normal limits.

On postpartum day #1, pt developed severe range blood pressures 
that did not respond to 10mg PO nifedipine x2. She was 
subsequently started on 24 hours of Magnesium for seizure 
prophylaxis. Pt required an additional 20mg IV labetalol for 
severe range blood pressures and was subsequently started on 
labetalol 200mg PO BID. During the remainder of her postpartum 
course she continued to have blood pressures above goal range 
requiring uptitration of her labetalol to 800mg PO TID on 
postpartum day #3. She received an additional 10mg PO nifedipine 
on postpartum day #3 for severe range blood pressures (183/110). 
On postpartum day#4 her antihypertensive medication regimen was 
changed to labetalol 400mg TID + nifedipine 30mg CR QD. Of note, 
overnight between postpartum day #3 and #4 her labetalol and 
nifedipine were held due to BPs in the 110s-120s/70s.

The remainder of her postpartum course was routine. By 
postpartum day #4 she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating 
independently, and her pain was controlled with oral 
medications. She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was 
then discharged home in stable condition with postpartum 
outpatient follow-up scheduled.

PROGRESS NOTE

I am here with ___.  We have been discussing his injuries.
Patient had APC 2 pelvic fracture with symphyseal disruption.
The patient had intraoperative dysrhythmia at his last
surgery and required intraoperative cardioversion, and
accordingly, we fixed the front of the symphysis, but did not
address posteriorly.  A postoperative CT scan reveals a
minimal widening through the posterior SI joint.

I have been discussing with ___, placement of an SI screw
across the right SI joint and the rationale for this as well
as the risks and benefits.  ___ is present for this
dictation.  He and I have gone over this.  ___ weighs 300
pounds.  He is ___ feet 1 inch.  This puts his BMI in the 45
range.  He has a symphyseal plate, but given his elevated
body mass index and his size, I am concerned about the
ability of the hardware to hold him in the front alone.
Certainly, this is procedure which is not without risk.  This
requires good visualization.  If we are able to get good
visualization today, then we will proceed with SI screw
placement.  If we cannot knee adequately with fluoroscopy to
place the screw, then we will not place it.

___ and I have discussed the potential benefits of this in
terms of holding his pelvis stable while it heals.  We have
also discussed the risk.  We have discussed potential
problems with L5 nerve root.  We discussed potential problems
with pelvic surgery in general, including major bleeding
complications and major neurovascular injury.  We discussed
potential for persistent pain and disruption of the SI joint
as well as posterior sacral pain and potential SI joint
arthritis, despite our best efforts, here.  I have discussed
this in detail with ___.  He understands what is involved
here.  He gives informed consent.  We plan to proceed
accordingly.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and stabilized in the ICU. The patient 
was normothermic and his electrolyte abnormalities were 
corrected. A brain death exam was performed and the patient was 
found to be absent of all brain activity. Given that the patient 
had a C1/C2 cord injury, an apnea test could not be completed. 
Therefore a cerebral completion scan was completed confirming 
brain death. The patient was pronounced brain dead when the 
report of this scan was finalized by the attending radiologist. 
The family agreed to organ donation and the patient's body was 
managed by the NEOB and the office of the medical examiner from 
that point forward.

she was given another bolus of one-liter of fluid.  

Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral 
pain medications.  The patient received Aspirin 325 mg twice 
daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The 
foley was removed and the patient was voiding independently 
thereafter. The surgical dressing was changed on POD#2 and the

erythema or abnormal drainage. The patient was seen daily by 
physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital 
course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the 
patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling well.  The 
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient's 
hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on 
an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly

Cardiac Arrest
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

CPR
Intubation
 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ presented after a witnessed arrest at home. He was 
resuscitated in the field by EMS after an ~30 minute downtime 
(without resuscitation during that time). RoSC was obtained by 
EMS, and he was transferred to the ___ ED. He again coded 5 
more times in the ED, due to PEA arrests, and underwent 5 rounds 
of CPR with intermittent, transient, and vasopressor- and 
inotrope-dependent RoSC before being admitted to the MICU. 
Immediately upon arrival to the ICU, he again suffered PEA 
arrest (while on norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and 
phenylephrine infusions), and which CPR and resuscitative 
efforts were again initiated. Despite over 20 minutes of CPR and 
ACLS, RoSC was unable to be achieved, resuscitative efforts were 
halted, and the patietn's wife was informed of his death.

Social History:

Family History:

Physical Exam:
In cardiac arrest on arrival.

Pupils mid-dilated, fixed. No pulses.
 
Pertinent Results:
In cardiac arrest on arrival; expired
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ experienced cardiac arrest again immediately upon 
admission to the MICU due to PEA. CPR was immediately initiated, 
with over 20 minutes of chest compressions, and multiple doses 
of epinephrine, bicarbonate, and calcium chloride administered 
per ACLS PEA arrest guidelines. Potential reversible causes for 
his recurrent PEA arrests were reviewed by the ICU team, but no 
obvious reversible cause was identified based on the available 
clinical data. Bedside ultrasound did not demonstrated recurrent 
pneumothoraces (he had bilateral chest tubes in place from the 
ED), nor did it demonstrate a significant pericardial effusion 
that would have been suggestive of tamponade. Pulmonary embolism 
was entertained as a possibility, but the risk / benefit 
considerations of systemic t-PA administration were felt to be 
prohibitive as the risk of critical hemorrhage after multiple 
rounds of chest compressions (and chest tubes placement) were 
determined to outweigh any potential benefit. 

In this setting, the consensus decision by all of the ICU health 
care providers participating in his resuscitation was to stop 
CPR and resuscitative efforts. The patient's wife was present at 
the bedside for the majority of his arrest and resuscitative 
efforts, and she endorsed understanding of why CPR was stopped. 
She endorsed understanding that Mr. ___ was dead and that 
ongoing CPR was not beneficial, and that it represented futile 
care. We provided emotional and psychological support, and 
ensured that all of her questions about his clinical status and 
our medical care were answered to the best of our ability. She 
thanked the ICU team for the care he had received during his 
brief ICU stay.

be febrile and tachypneic, overall concerning for sepsis. Over 
the last few months, patient has had several ED visits and 
hospital admissions. After extensive discussions with the

symptoms and concern for meningismus representing subacute 
meningitis, pt referred to ED for further evaluation.

CSF analysis was significant for pleocytosis (out of proportion 
to RBCs in CSF). Due to these concerning signs/symptoms, pt was 
admitted for empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis w/ IV 
abx (CTX and vancomycin).

Imaging found fluid collection in L maxillary sinus concerning 
for possible nidus of CNS infection. ENT consulted; scope showed 
no evidence of sinusitis.

Pt was also found to have component of cervical muscle spasms, 
which were at least contributing to cervical/head pain. Started 
on tizanidine. ___ evaluated pt for possible limitations due to 
pain; evaluated her as not needing further therapy at this time.
Pain was also treated w/ acetaminophen prn and ibuprofen prn.

Cultures (blood and CSF) remained negative by day of D/C 
(___). Abx were discontinued.

Pt was discharged to f/up w/ primary care and w/ Neurology.

Transitional issues:
Pt was given rx for amitriptyline to be started if head and 
cervical pain requires acetaminophen and ibuprofen more often 
than half of the days of the week.
We recommend that pt have serum Tb test obtained to r/o the 
possibility of Tb infection as cause.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___ was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted for 
concern for meningitis. You underwent a lumbar puncture which 
showed an elevated white count and thus you were started on 
antibiotics. However, your cultures have remained negative and 
thus the antibiotics were discontinued. For your associated neck 
pain you were started on a muscle relaxer tizanidine. We also 
will try you on a medication called amitriptyline for headache 
prevention.

We would like for you to still get one more blood test performed 
to test for tuberculosis, since sometimes chronic meningitis can 
be associated with this. Your PCP can perform this test.

Please follow up with your PCP. We will also arrange an 
outpatient neurology appointment for you. if you don't hear from 
the clinic within the next few days, please call the number

and coags were ordered prior to the OR.  The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.  Prior to proceeding to the back, the 
patient's EBL was 1200 mL. The patient underwent an 
uncomplicated D&C under ultrasound guidance and placement of a 
bakri balloon. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells 
intra-op and her hematocrit was trended. Her Bakri placement and 
vaginal packing were removed by PPD1.

Medications
You will be given a prescription for pain medicine.  The pain 
medication is a codeine derivative and should be taken as 
directed.  

Please take one full strength aspirin (325 mg) each day for six 
weeks to decrease the risk of having a complication related to a 
blood clot.

Please take a stool softener, like Colace (Docusate Sodium 
100mg), twice a day while taking narcotics to prevent 
constipation.

Dressing
Leave your dressing for 48 hours after your surgery.  After 48 
hours, you may remove your dressing.  LEAVE THE TAPE STRIPS OVER

CT chest 
FINDINGS: 
 
Evaluation quite limited given noncontrast technique.  The 
imaged base of the
neck is unremarkable including the partially visualized thyroid. 
 The thoracic
aorta appears normal in course and caliber without appreciable 
atherosclerotic
calcification.  The main pulmonary artery appears normal in 
size.  Evaluation
for lymphadenopathy limited in the absence of IV contrast.  The 
heart is
normal in size and shape.
 
There is a rounded confluent consolidation measuring 
approximately 3.5 x 3.6 x
3.1 cm within the superior segment of the right upper lobe 
containing a
central gas-filled cavity measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.5 x 
1.7 cm. 
Peripheral ground-glass opacity is noted.  Findings are most 
suggestive of a
necrotizing pneumonia though a cavitary malignancy is not 
entirely excluded. 
A repeat CT is advised post treatment to ensure complete 
resolution.  There is
mild emphysema with mild subpleural reticular opacities which 
are nonspecific
though could reflect chronic lung disease.
 
In the imaged upper abdomen, no discrete abnormality is seen.
 
Bones: No worrisome lytic or blastic osseous lesion.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
1.  Rounded consolidation in the right lower lobe superior 
segment with
peripheral ground-glass opacity and central cavitation most 
suggestive of a
complicated/necrotizing pneumonia.  Please note close follow-up 
is advised as
malignancy not excluded.
2.  Emphysema with subpleural reticulation suggesting chronic 
lung disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
Her postpartum course was complicated by a readmission for 
pre-eclampsia severe by headaches and BPs. She received 24 hours 
of magnesium postpartum. PIH labs were ordered and showed 
elevated ALT to 46 and Uric Acid of 6.4. Labs were otherwise 
normal. Neurology was consulted for her headache. They felt 
there was low suspicion for an acute intracranial process but 
recommended a MRA/MRV. Her MRA/MRV was unremarkable. She 
received two doses of IV Hydralazine for severe range BPs and 
required no further anti-hypertensives agents. Her pain was 
treated with oral pain medications. She ambulated and her foley 
was discontinued and she voided spontaneously. Her diet was 
advanced without incident.

History of Present Illness:
It was my pleasure to see Ms. ___ once again on ___.  As you well know, she has been under my care for the
workup of a cystic lesion involving the left lateral inferior
neck.  She completed a CT scan on ___ and was unable
to follow up until recently to review her prior fine needle
aspiration and the results of the CT scan.  Together, we 
reviewed
the imaging study, which has identified a well-circumscribed
cystic lesion within the anterior left lower neck at the level 
of
the thyroid gland, just deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. 
It extends to the level just below the clavicle.  The morphology
and location favored a cervical thymic cyst versus a unilocular
lymphatic malformation.  A third branchial cleft cyst could also
be considered.  Given these findings and the continued presence
of the cystic lesion, I have recommended a surgical resection.

presenting with intermittent rectal bleeding x ___ years (worse in 
last 3 mo) presented to PCP for fatigue and lightheadedness as 
well as intermittent hematochezia, found to be newly anemic to 
6.1. 

Based on iron studies, retic count, recent colonoscopy, most 
likely possibility is that she has internal hemorrhoids and has 
had intermittent bleeding for years. This has depleted her iron 
stores and led to a suboptimal BM response and drop in Hgb.

After 2u PRBC her Hgb bumped to 8.2 and has been stable. now 
asymptomatic. No signif rectal bleeding.

Colorectal cancer felt that given clinical stability that they 
would prefer to do a possible hemorrhoid removal as outpatient.

Given depleted iron stores gave her one dose of IV iron here and 
then have started her on oral iron as an outpatient. 

Transitional issues:
- recheck hgb in one week. Ensure Hgb rising and reticulocytosis 
adequate. If not, then reassess for other sources of anemia
- Ensure f/u with CRC set

requiring intubation and septic shock, secondary to recurrent 
aspiration PNA.

Patient was initially admitted to the MICU, improved and was 
called out, and subsequently required re-admission to the MICU 
for recurrent aspiration event and pulmonary edema as described 
below. After discussion with the patient's HCP, it was decided

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___ Ms. ___ underwent spontaneous vaginal delivery. 

Her post-partum course was complicated by fevers, headache, and 
neck stiffness which was initially concerning for meningitis vs. 
epidural abscess vs. atypical migraines. Her labs were notable 
for normal WBC count. She was seen by Neurology and Anesthesia 
teams. She underwent lumbar puncture and was started on empiric 
therapy for meningitis (IV vancomycin, cefepime and acyclovir). 
CSF fluid revealed no evidence of infection, so antibiotics were 
stopped. She underwent a chest x-ray which showed  Small pleural 
fluid, no infiltrates, and bilateral oligemia in the upper 
lungs. Her CTPA was negative for PE, and had mild centrilobular 
emphysema. Per neurology recommendations, she underwent a head 
CT which showed no acute process, and an MRI spine showed no 
evidence of epidural abscess. MRI of the head was negative for 
venous sinus thrombosis, however had a finding of Chiari 
malformation with no syringohydromyelia. Neurology recommended 
outpatient follow-up.

For her headache she was given IV hydration and fioricet. She 
also developed chest pain, which resolved on its own. Troponins 
were negative, and EKG showed no evidence of ischemia. A repeat 
EKG the next day was stable. Repeat labs were again negative for 
leukocytosis, and lactate was found to be downtrending. Flu 
testing and UA and urine culture were negative.

By postpartum day 7, her pain was well-controlled with oral 
medications, her neck stiffness and tenderness was improving, 
and she was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently. 
She was afebrile with stable vital signs. She was then 
discharged home in stable condition with postpartum outpatient 
follow-up scheduled.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology service ___ for 
observation for an ectopic pregnancy. She was being followed for 
a known tubal ectopic pregnancy, having received 3 doses of 
methotrexate. She initially presented with worsening abdominal 
pain and vaginal bleeding, so was admitted for observation. Her 
vitals and exam were remarkable for minimal abdominal 
tenderness. Her pelvic ultrasound showed some blood around the 
tubal mass, with trace fluid in the abdomen, but she required no 
further pain medication and her hematocrit remained stable 
overnight. Her hCG levels decreased as well. Our working 
diagnosis is tubal abortion.  Given her improved status and 
benign abdominal exam on discharge and stable vital signs 
throughout her hospitalization, she was discharged home with 
close follow-up to continue trending HCG levels to 0 under the 
Chief Resident Service's care.

The Pt was taken to the OR with Dr ___ a right wrist 
fusion and shorteing of the radius and extensor tendons on 
___ and tolerated the procedure well.  Please see separately 
dictated operative note for details.  Post operatively, the 
patient recovered without event in the surgical pacu and later 
in the surgical ICU as secondary to her venous malformation she 
had significant oozing from the operative site postoperatively.  
This is standard for this patient.  The venous ooze generally 
slows down after several hours of the drain on continuous low 
wall suction, and thic can only be done in an ICU.  
FICU COURSE

wound drain needed to be hooked up to wall suction, which cannot 
be accommodated on the floor. She remained stable overnight with 
no issues. She was continued of IV cefazolin. She had oxycodone, 
Tylenol, and dilaudid PCA for pain, which was well controlled. 
Her drain was put to bulb suction in the morning per hand 
surgery recommendations and continued to hold suction well with 
minimal output of only serosanguinous drainage. By the afternoon 
of POD1 her RUE block had worn off and pain was well controlled 
on PO pain meds.  She was eager for home.  

on the morning of POD1 she was pain controlled on PO pain meds, 
she was ambulating independently, tolerating a regular diet, and 
voiding without difficulty.  Her splint was removed and revealed 
an incision that was CDI without signs of hematoma.  The drain 
put out 100cc overnight and was slowing down and thinning out.  
It was transitioned to a bulb without event.  She expressed her 
readiness for home and was discharged to home in a healthy 
condition
